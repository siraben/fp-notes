## Landmark Papers

John McCarthy, “Recursive Expressions and Their Computation By Machine,
Part 1”.  Communications of the ACM, vol. 3, no. 4 (1960).
[PDF available](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf)
The paper in which McCarthy describes LISP, and introduces several
ideas that became fundamental to the implementation of functional
languages, including garbage collection.

Guy L. Steele, Jr., “Debunking the ‘Expensive Procedure Call’ Myth, or,
Procedure Call Implementations Considered Harmful, or, Lambda: The
Ultimate GOTO”.  MIT AI Memo 443, 1977.
[PDF available](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/5753/AIM-443.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y).
Steele shows that the notion that functional programming languages
are impractically slow is pure myth.

John Backus, “Can Programming Be Liberated From a Von Neumann Style?”
Communications of the ACM, vol. 21, no. 8 (1978).  Backus’s 1977 Turing
Award lecture presents the “FP” language and makes a detailed, insightful
argument for functional programming.

Philip Wadler, “Monads For Functional Programming”
In Manfred Broy, *Program Design Calculi*.  Springer, 1993.
[PDF available](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf)
The paper which introduced monads as a major unifying concept
in functional programming.  Wadler’s elegant presentation makes this idea
seem simple and natural.
