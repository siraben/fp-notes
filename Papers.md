## Landmark Papers

John McCarthy, “Recursive Expressions and Their Computation By Machine,
Part 1”.  Communications of the ACM, vol. 3, no. 4 (1960).
[PDF available](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf)

The paper in which McCarthy describes LISP, and introduces several
ideas that became fundamental to the implementation of functional
languages, including garbage collection.

Guy L. Steele, Jr., “Debunking the ‘Expensive Procedure Call’ Myth, or,
Procedure Call Implementations Considered Harmful, or, Lambda: The
Ultimate GOTO”.  MIT AI Memo 443, 1977.
[PDF available](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/5753/AIM-443.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y)

Steele shows that the notion that functional programming languages are
impractically slow is pure myth.

John Backus, “Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?”
Communications of the ACM, vol. 21, no. 8 (1978).

Backus’s 1977 Turing Award lecture presents the “FP” language and
makes a detailed, insightful argument for functional programming.
Includes discussion on “the Algebra of Programs”, in which programs
are manipulated via algebraic laws.  Calling this algebra “a game
amateurs can profitably play and enjoy”, Backus proves a handful of
theorems and shows how they can be used to prove the correctness of
larger FP programs.  This paper is so rich that it’s hard to believe
it was presented as a lecture.
 
Philip Wadler, “Monads For Functional Programming”
In Manfred Broy, *Program Design Calculi*.  Springer, 1993.
[PDF available](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf)

The paper which introduced monads as a major unifying concept in
functional programming.  Wadler’s elegant presentation makes this idea
seem simple and natural.
