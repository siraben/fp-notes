[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

There is a lot of literature on Functional Programming (FP).  This
repository aims to catalogue papers, books, blog posts and notes on
the myriad of topics out there, hopefully in some coherent fashion.

## Planned content
- Commentary on papers and books
- Organization of content by topics
- Selected solutions to exercises

## Non-goals
We aim to document and describe ideas that are timeless in nature, so
the following will not be discussed as much.  Appropriate references
to dedicated resources can be given instead.

- Features/language extensions pertaining to a functional language
- Specific library implementations
