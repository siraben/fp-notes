# Notes on Functional Programming and related topics
[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

There is a lot of literature on Functional Programming (FP).  This
repository aims to catalogue papers, books, blog posts and notes on
the myriad of topics out there, hopefully in some coherent fashion.

## Planned content
- Notes on reasoning about programs, eventually to be formalized in a
  proof assistant
- Commentary on papers and books
- Organization of content by topics
- Selected solutions to exercises

## Non-goals
We aim to document and describe ideas that are timeless in nature, so
the following will not be discussed as much.  Appropriate references
to dedicated resources can be given instead.

- Features/language extensions pertaining to a functional language
- Specific library implementations

## Guides on examples
We aim to use languages (code and prose) that are suitable and natural
to the topic being described.  For instance;

- When presenting concepts using dependent types, prefer the use of
  dependently-typed languages over Haskell with language extensions.
- When formalizing proofs, prefer Coq for initial formalization,
  rewrite in Agda for more readable proofs, if needed.
