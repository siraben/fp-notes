# Books

A listing of books organized by category, along with commentary on
their scope, depth and prerequisite knowledge.

## Introductory FP

Abelson and Sussman, *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*

Hutton, *Programming in Haskell*

Bird, *Introduction to Functional Programming Using Haskell*

Paulson, *ML for the Working Programmer*

## Data structures and algorithms

Okasaki, *Purely Functional Data Structures*

Bird, *Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design*

## FP and Mathematics

Bird and de Moor, *Algebra of Programming*

Milewski, *Category Theory for Programmers*

## Type Theory

Pierce, *Types and Programming Languages*

Pierce, *Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages*

Daniel P. Friedman and David Thrane Christiansen, *The Little Typer*.
MIT Press, 2018.  Explores type theory through simple, concrete examples.
Uses Pie, a dependently-typed Lisp-like language.  Like all of Friedman’s
“Little books”, charming and food-filled.  Also features a closing poem
by Conor McBride.

## Compilers for functional languages

Appel, *Compiling with Continuations*

## Interpreters for functional languages

Friedman and Wand, *Essentials of Programming Languages*

## Theorem proving in a proof assistant

Pierce et al, *Logical Foundations*

## Lambda Calculus

J. Roger Hindley and Jonathan P. Seldin, *Lambda-Calculus and
Combinators*.  Cambridge University Press, 2008.  Good foundational
text, for those comfortable with a fast-moving, formal approach.

## FP Topics

Jeremy Gibbons and Oege de Moor, eds., *The Fun Of Programming*.
Palmgrave Macmillan, 2003.  A collection of chapters on various topics
by a number of eminent functional programming researchers, including
Okasaki, Gibbons (the classic “Origami Programming”), Hudak,
Peyton-Jones, Wadler, and others.  The style is often very close to
Bird’s work; program calculation is used extensively, and there are
many references to *Introduction to Functional Programming Using
Haskell*.  An excellent follow-on to that book.
