# Books

A listing of books organized by category, along with commentary on
their scope, depth and prerequisite knowledge.

## Introductory FP

Abelson and Sussman, *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*

Hutton, *Programming in Haskell*

Three incarnations of Bird & Wadler’s introductory text:

  * Richard Bird and Philip Wadler, *Introduction To Functional
    Programming*.  Prentice Hall, 1988.  “The classic text on
    functional programming”, according to Philip Bewig.  Elegant and
    rigorous.
    [PDF available.](https://usi-pl.github.io/lc/sp-2015/doc/Bird_Wadler.%20Introduction%20to%20Functional%20Programming.1ed.pdf)

  * Richard Bird, *Introduction to Functional Programming Using Haskell*.
    Prentice Hall, 1998.  Contains lots of new material, including
    an introduction to monadic programming and typeclasses.  The title
    is appropriate: the book uses Haskell to introduce functional
    programming, and doesn’t cover the specifics of any Haskell
    implementation.

  * Richard Bird, *Thinking Functionally With Haskell*.  Cambridge
    University Press, 2015.  More conversational and more
    Haskell-oriented than the previous book, while covering most of the
    same material (and some new).

Paulson, *ML for the Working Programmer*

Greg Michaelson, *An Introduction To Functional Programming Through
Lambda Calculus*.  Dover, 2011.
[PDF of older edition available.](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~greg/books/gjm.lambook88.pdf)

## Data structures and algorithms

Okasaki, *Purely Functional Data Structures*

Bird, *Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design*

## FP and Mathematics

Bird and de Moor, *Algebra of Programming*.
Focuses on program calculation from a categorical viewpoint,
emphasizing F-algebras, catamorphisms and universal properties.
Generalizes this approach to work with relations too, allowing for
derivation of programs from specification.  Optimization and dynamic
programming problems are solved with this new viewpoint.

Milewski, *Category Theory for Programmers*
[PDF available.](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf/releases/download/v1.3.0/category-theory-for-programmers.pdf)
## Type Theory

Pierce, *Types and Programming Languages*

Pierce, *Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages*

Daniel P. Friedman and David Thrane Christiansen, *The Little Typer*.
MIT Press, 2018.  Explores type theory through simple, concrete examples.
Uses Pie, a dependently-typed Lisp-like language.  Like all of Friedman’s
“Little books”, charming and food-filled.  Also features a closing poem
by Conor McBride.

## Compilers for functional languages

Appel, *Compiling with Continuations*

## Interpreters for functional languages

Friedman and Wand, *Essentials of Programming Languages*

## Theorem proving in a proof assistant

Pierce et al, *Logical Foundations*

## Lambda Calculus

J. Roger Hindley and Jonathan P. Seldin, *Lambda-Calculus and
Combinators*.  Cambridge University Press, 2008.  Good foundational
text, for those comfortable with a fast-moving, formal approach.

## FP Topics

Jeremy Gibbons and Oege de Moor, eds., *The Fun Of Programming*.
Palmgrave Macmillan, 2003.  A collection of chapters on various topics
by a number of eminent functional programming researchers, including
Okasaki, Gibbons (the classic “Origami Programming”), Hudak,
Peyton-Jones, Wadler, and others.  The style is often very close to
Bird’s work; program calculation is used extensively, and there are
many references to *Introduction to Functional Programming Using
Haskell*.  An excellent follow-on to that book.
